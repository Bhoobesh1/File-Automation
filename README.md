## 🔍 How It Works

The File Organizer follows a simple and efficient workflow to organize files automatically:

1. **User Input**  
   The user enters the path of the folder that needs to be organized.

2. **Directory Scan**  
   The application scans all items in the given folder and identifies files (ignoring sub-folders).

3. **Extension Detection**  
   Each file’s extension (such as `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.txt`) is extracted.

4. **Folder Creation**  
   If a folder for a specific extension does not exist, the application automatically creates it.

5. **File Movement**  
   Files are moved into their respective extension-based folders.

6. **Completion Message**  
   Once all files are organized, a success message is displayed to the user.

This process happens instantly with a single click.
